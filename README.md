# CatAdventures

A simple 2D platform jumping tile-based game made in Java using OpenGL library. I wrote the game engine from scratch and gather all the images, sounds from multiple online sources to make levels, character animation, and sound effects. 

- You can open the game by executing the CatAdventure.jar file.
